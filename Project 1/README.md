Description of Project:
Navigating a known Obstacle Course with the Lego Robot
The objective of this assignment is to navigate a mobile robot through an obstacle course to a goal
location. The start position of the robot as well as the locations of all obstacles and of the goal are
given before the robot is started.
The workspace for the robot is a rectangular area, 4.88 m x 3.05 m in size (this corresponds to exactly
16 x 10 floor tiles in the lab). Obstacles are black cardboard squares 0.305 m x 0.305 m in size (the
size of 1 floor tile) which will be placed in the workspace. The goal is a black circle with a radius of
0.305 m. To simplify experiments, the center of the goal area, of the obstacles, and of the start will
coincide with the intersection point of four floor tiles and their orientation will be aligned with the
tiles.
