Description of Project:
Behavior-based Fire Alarm Robot
The goal of this project is to design a behavior-based fire detection robot that is able to move from
an unknown position in an in-door environment to look for a fire, raise an alarm, and extinguish
it. The robot should use a set of behaviors, including “wander” (search) and “wall following”.
The walls of the rooms are approximately 15cm high and the fire location will be indicated by a
burning candle (in a glass candle holder) on top of a differently colored area the size of half a floor
tile. There will be no door openings to the outside of the house.
